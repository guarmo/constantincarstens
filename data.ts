      "The project HeDuDa was founded in 2019 by Constantin Carstens. The idea originating from his fascination with the way we perceive our daily surroundings. All the small stories and narratives we can find in everyday life, the experiences we collect and all the conditions we are surrounded by. This creates a vibrant and dynamic world of impressions and forms the basic foundation of his work. He invites us on a journey to explore this world together, not focusing on his own perception, more as an invitation for the perceiver's own engagement. His approach of exploring is often intuitive and musically or sonically influenced. HeDuDa's work focuses on music of any genre ,sound and video works as well as installations and live acts (DJ/Liveset).",
