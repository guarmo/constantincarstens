      The project HeDuDa was founded in 2019 by Constantin Carstens. The idea
      originating from his fascination with the way we perceive our daily
      surroundings. All the small stories and narratives we can find in everyday
      life, the experiences we collect and all the conditions we are surrounded
      by. This creates a vibrant and dynamic world of impressions and forms the
      basic foundation of his work. He invites us on a journey to explore this
      world together, not focusing on his own perception, more as an invitation
      for the perceiver's own engagement. His approach of exploring is often
      intuitive and musically or sonically influenced. HeDuDa's work focuses on
      music of any genre ,sound and video works as well as installations and
      live acts (DJ/Liveset).
