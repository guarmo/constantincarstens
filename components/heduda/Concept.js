      The project HeDuDa was founded in 2019 by Constantin Carstens. The idea
      originates from the fascination for the perception of our daily
      surroundings. All the small stories and narratives we can find in
      everydays life, all the experiences we collect and all the conditions we
      are surrounded by, is creating a vibrant and dynamic world of impressions
      and HeDuDaâ€™s basic foundation of his work. He invites us on a journey of
      exploring this world together, not focusing mainly on his own perception,
      more as an invitation for the perceiver's own engagement. His approach of
      exploring is often intuitive and musically or sonically influenced so
      HeDuDa's works focusing on music of any genre, sound and video works to
      installations and live act (DJ/Liveset).{" "}
